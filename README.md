# Word-Guess-Game
What this project does.
    This is a simple hangman style game. When you intiate the game by pressing a button the game will start up. You have 10 guesses to get the word right or you lose. 

    The theme here is Western. All words are related to the western theme. 

This project is helpful becasue it is a fun and simple excersice to evaluate the use of Javascript to create a game. This project was very difficult for a newbie like myself. I was able to cobble this code together, as well as rearrange and troubleshoot based on the vast resources of the internet.
